## Notes taken when reading CSS reference

- `vertical-align: middle | other` only works in `th | td`
- There are 5 types of position property in css:
  - **static** : it is default. It has no effect of top, bottom, left or right property.
  - **relative** : setting the top, bottom, ledt and right properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
  - **fixed**: an element with fixed positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled, The top, bottom, right, left properties are used to position the element.
  - **absolute**
  - **sticky**
